                   She was born on a sunny Friday in May in 1992. Growing up on farmland of Muncy, Pennsylvania
                   (population of 2,500), she enjoyed living the small town life. After graduating high school, she
                   went on to Ursinus College (Collegeville, Pennsylvania) to study Chemistry and Spanish. She then
                   accepted a Chemist position at Philadelphia Energy Solutions upon graduation.

                   She now currently resides in the Graduate Hospital neighborhood of Philadelphia with her two
                   roommates. She spends her free time volunteering in STEM education teaching science to kids in
                   elementary schools with low funding. She also loves to read Harry Potter and is an avid
                   Philadelphia Eagles fan.
